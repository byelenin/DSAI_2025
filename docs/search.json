    "text": "Course Description\nThis course serves two primary objectives for students already versed in core data analysis methods.\nFirst, it equips students with practical experience in harnessing AI technologies to enhance analytical productivity while fostering critical discussions on human agency in data analysis. As AI capabilities expand, the course examines the evolving roles of artificial intelligence and human expertise across analytical domains.\nSecond, the course focuses on leveraging large language models and programming tools to acquire, process, and analyze unstructured big data, including spatial data analysis, web scraping, text analysis, and OCR applications. Rather than emphasizing theoretical foundations, the course adopts a hands-on approach through real-world case studies and project-based learning.\nThe course addresses a fundamental question: how can economists effectively integrate AI into their research toolkit while maintaining analytical rigor? Through guided exploration of AI-assisted workflows, students develop both technical competencies and critical perspectives on artificial intelligence in economic research.\nStudents will complete empirical research projects demonstrating the integration of AI tools with traditional economic analysis methods.\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nParticipation（\\(10\\%\\)）\nProposal Presentations for Group Projects (\\(50\\%\\))\nPreliminary results for Group Projects (\\(40\\%\\))\n\n\n\nTextbooks\nThe course have no required textbooks, but the following books and online resources are recommended for further reading and reference:\n\nHadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, R for Data Science:Second edition,O’Reilly Media, 2023.\nGareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R: Second edition, Springer, 2023.\nImmanuel Trummer, Data Analysis with LLMs: Texts,tables,images and sound, O’Reilly Media, 2025."

Many strategies in machine learning are explicitly designed to reduce this test error, possibly at the expense of increased training error. These strategies are collectively known as regularisation and they are instrumental for good performance of any kind of prediction or classification model, especially in the context of small data (many features, few samples).\nIn the hands-on tutorial we will use R to perform an integrated analysis of multi-omics data with penalised regression.\n\nContact\nInstructor A: contact\nInstructor B: contact\nInstructor C: contact"
